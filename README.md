# Corner-shape-detection
The goal of this project is to detect basic geometric shapes on an static image. 

The program colors every corner of each shape and prints out which of these colors belong to a given shape.

You need to install python, numpy and opencv, after that you can run the code as an executable or through an IDE.
I've included a couple images in the folder, you can alter the input images of the python file in line 32-37.
